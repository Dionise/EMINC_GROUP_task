<h2>Purpose</h2>
   The main scope of this task is to transform the FHIR protocol of patient data into a workable and readable tabular format for analytics teams.
My idea was to create a simple prototype of a Search engine to help analytics teams to visualise more accessible data.
 
<h2>Workflow of the Data</h2>
Data is extracted from the S3 bucket using open-source library boto3 to the server; after that, this data is transferred to MongoDB using another library, PyMongo. Data can be found using the function of PyMongo see https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html\
  
  
In this task I used ‚öíÔ∏è :
1. AWS S3 Buket;
2. Django Framework;
3. MongoDB;

üöÄ You can check the working project at http://178.128.36.56
This is the real ID of the Patient, which you can type in search input:
  
6e4ac285-2a8d-a30d-5ecb-e32cb595a876\
3635f0e6-d517-43f9-c4b2-61ea16a60fa3\

Note: In continues, we can create a form with multiple fields which would help the annalistic team to be classified our patient data  using aggregation methods instead of finding just one Patient by ID.
